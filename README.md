# PythonTutorial
Just a series of python programs/files that have been used in my python tutorial (One I have created).
The tutorial itself can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTmgcmmHrgcOuCNv2Usmyfj1bav9RhjZU .
The tutorial is free, and should not include any advertising, as it is not monetized.
